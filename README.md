# Bluetooth Library Patcher

## Description

This module attends to avoid losing bluetooth pairings after reboot or airplane mode switch on rooted samsung devices.

It patches on the fly the bluetooth library.

It is reported to work on exynos S10e, S10, S10+, N9, N10+, us snapdragon S10+, chinese snapdragon N10+ and S10+ on Android 10 / One UI 2. Also works with exynos N9 and chinese/global snapdragon N10 on Pie. So it is expected to work with other devices and older OS.

It supports Android 10 and should also work with Pie and Oreo (8.0/8.1).

If it fails on your device, please post your /system/lib64/libbluetooth.so and /system/build.prop files on XDA thread and I will be able to add support for it.
