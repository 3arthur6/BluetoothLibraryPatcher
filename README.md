# Bluetooth Library Patcher

## Description

This module attends to avoid losing bluetooth pairings after reboot or airplane mode switch on rooted samsung devices.

It patches on the fly the bluetooth library.

It is reported to work on exynos S10e, S10, S10+, N9, N10+ and snapdragon S10+ on Android 10 / One UI 2.
So it is expected to work with other devices.

It support Android 10 and should also work with Pie and Oreo (8.0/8.1).
